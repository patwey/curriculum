Federal and state governments publish a huge amount of data. You can find
a large collection of it on [Data.gov](http://data.gov) -- everything from land surveys
to pollution to census data.

As programmers, we can use those data sets to ask and answer questions. Starting
with CSV data we will:

* build a "Data Access Layer" which allows us to query/search the underlying data
* build a "Relationships Layer" which creates connections between related data
* build an "Analysis Layer" which uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions

We'll build upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation.

## Project Overview

### Goals

* Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools
* Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
* Connect related objects together through references

### Getting Started

1. One team member clones the repository at https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount.
2. `cd headcount`
3. `git remote rm origin`
4. Create your own new `headcount` repository on GitHub, then add that remote to your `headcount` from the command line.
5. Push your repository to the new remote origin.
6. Add your teammate(s) as collaborators.
7. Create a [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io) account for project management.

## Base Expectations

### Data Access Layer

#### `DistrictRepository`

The `DistrictRepository` is responsible for holding and searching our `District`
instances. It offers the following methods:

* `find_by_name` - returns either `nil` or an instance of `District` having done a *case insensitive* search
* `find_all_matching` - returns either `[]` or one or more matches which contain the supplied name fragment, *case insensitive*

There is no one data file that contains just the districts. The data must be extracted from one of the other files.

#### `District`

The `District` is the top of our data hierarchy. It has the following methods:

* `name` - returns the upcased string name of the district
* `statewide_testing` - returns an instance of `StatewideTesting`
* `enrollment` - returns an instance of `Enrollment`

#### `StatewideTesting`

The instance of this object represents data from the following files:

* `3rd grade students scoring proficient or above on the CSAP_TCAP.csv`
* `8th grade students scoring proficient or above on the CSAP_TCAP.csv`
* `Average proficiency on the CSAP_TCAP by race_ethnicity_Math.csv`
* `Average proficiency on the CSAP_TCAP by race_ethnicity_Reading.csv`
* `Average proficiency on the CSAP_TCAP by race_ethnicity_Writing.csv`

An instance this class offers the following methods:

##### `.proficient_by_grade(grade)`

as three digit floats.

*Example*:

```
statewide_testing.proficient_by_grade(3)
# => {2008 => {:math => 0.857, :reading => 0.866, :writing => 0.671},

##### [TODO: more methods for this category]

### Relationships Layer

*TODO: These are just a sketch of where we're going -- don't try to implement this yet!.*

Assume we start with loading our data and finding a school district like this:

```
dr = DistrictRepository.from_csv('./data')
district = dr.find_by_name("ACADEMY 20")
```

Then each `district` has several child objects loaded with data allowing us to ask questions like this:

```
district.enrollment.in_year(2009) # => 22620
district.enrollment.graduation_rate_for_high_school_in_year(2010) # => 0.895
district.statewide_testing.proficient_for_subject_by_grade_in_year(:math, 3, 2008) # => 0.857
```

### Analysis Layer

Our analysis is centered on answering questions about the data.

Who will answer those questions? Assuming we have a `dr` that's an instance of `DistrictRepository` let's initialize a `HeadcountAnalyst` like this:

```
ha = HeadcountAnalyst.new(dr)
```

Then ask/answer these questions:

#### Where is the most growth happening in statewide testing?

We have district data about 3rd and 8th grade achievement in reading, math, and writing. Consider that our data sources have absolute values, not growth. We're interested in who is making the most progress, not who scores the highest. That means calculating growth by comparing the absolute values across two or more years.

##### Finding a single leader

```
ha.top_statewide_testing_year_over_year_growth(:subject => :math)
# => ['the top district name', 0.123]
```

Where `0.123` is their average percentage growth across years. If there are three years of proficiency data, that's `((year 2 - year 1) + (year 3 - year 2))/2`.

##### Finding multiple leaders

Let's say we want to be able to find several top districts using the same calculations:

```
ha.top_statewide_testing_year_over_year_growth(:top => 3, :subject => :math) # => [['top district name', growth_1],['second district name', growth_2],['third district name', growth_3]]
```

Where `growth_1` through `growth_3` represents their average growth across years.

##### Across all subjects

What about growth across all three subject areas?

```
ha.top_statewide_testing_year_over_year_growth
# => ['the top district name', 0.111]
```

Where `0.111` is the district's average percentage growth across years across subject areas.

But that considers all three subjects in equal proportion. No Child Left Behind guidelines generally emphasize reading and math, so let's add the ability to weight subject areas:

```
ha.top_statewide_testing_year_over_year_growth(:weighting => {:math = 0.5, :reading => 0.5, :writing => 0.0})
# => ['the top district name', 0.111]
```

The weights *must* add up to 1.

#### Does Kindergarten participation affect outcomes?

In many states, including Colorado, Kindergarten is offered at public schools but is not free for all residents. Denver, for instance, will charge as much as $310/month for Kindergarten. There's then a disincentive to enroll a child in Kindergarten. Does participation in Kindergarten with other factors/outcomes?

##### How does a district's kindergarten participation rate compare to the state average?

First, let's ask how an individual district's participation percentage compares to the statewide average:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_rate_variation('district_name', :against => 'state') # => 0.123
```

Where `0.123` is the percentage difference between the district and the state. A negative percentage implies that the district performs lower than the state average.

##### How does a district's kindergarten participation rate compare to another district?

Let's next compare this variance against another district:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_rate_variation('district_name', :against => 'second_district') # => 0.123
```

Where `0.123` is the percentage difference between the primary district and the against district. Negative percentage implies that the district performs lower than the against district.

##### How does kindergarten participation variation compare to the median household income variation?

Does a higher median income mean more kids enroll in Kindergarten? For a single district:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_against_household_income('district_name') # => 1.2
```

Consider the *kindergarten variation* to be the result calculated against the state average as described above. The *median income variation* is a similar calculation of the district's median income divided by the state average median income. Then dividing the *kindergarten variation* by the *median income variation* results in `1.2` in the sample.

If this result is close to `1`, then we'd infer that the *kindergarten variation* and the *median income variation* are closely related.

##### Statewide does the kindergarten participation correlate with the median household income?

Let's consider the `kindergarten_participation_against_household_income` and set a correlation window between `0.6` and `1.5`. If the result is in that range then we'll say that these percentages are correlated. For a single district:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_household_income(:for => 'district name') # => true
```

Then let's look statewide. If more than 70% of districts across the state show a correlation, then we'll answer `true`. If it's less than `70%` we'll answer `false`.

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_household_income(:for => 'state') # => true
```

And let's add the ability to just consider a subset of districts:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_household_income(:across => ['district_1', 'district_2', 'district_3', 'district_4']) # => false
```

##### How does kindergarten participation variation compare to the high school graduation variation?

There's thinking that kindergarten participation has long-term effects. Given our limited data set, let's *assume* that variance in kindergarten rates for a given district is similar to when current high school students were kindergarten age (~10 years ago). Let's compare the variance in kindergarten participation and high school graduation.

For a single district:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_against_high_school_graduation('district_name') # => 1.2
```

Call *kindergarten variation* the result of dividing the district's kindergarten participation by the statewide average. Call *graduation variation* the result of dividing the district's graduation rate by the statewide average. Divide the *kindergarten variation* by the *graduation variation* to find the *kindergarten-graduation variance*.

If this result is close to `1`, then we'd infer that the *kindergarten variation* and the *graduation variation* are closely related.

##### Does Kindergarten participation predict high school graduation?

Let's consider the `kindergarten_participation_against_high_school_graduation` and set a correlation window between `0.6` and `1.5`. If the result is in that range then we'll say that they are correlated. For a single district:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_high_school_graduation(:for => 'district name') # => true
```

Then let's look statewide. If more than 70% of districts across the state show a correlation, then we'll answer `true`. If it's less than `70%` we'll answer `false`.

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_high_school_graduation(:for => 'state') # => true
```

Then let's do the same calculation across a subset of districts:

```
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_high_school_graduation(:across => ['district_1', 'district_2', 'district_3', 'district_4']) # => true
```

#### *TODO: More analysis coming soon!*

Some ideas:

* How economically diverse are districts? Does Title 1 designation or Free/Reduced price lunch vary inversely with median household income? Do districts tend to be bifurcated or homogenous?
* With the understanding that a special education designation includes both academic and behavioral disorders, do we see a correlation between the percentages of students with Special Education diagnoses and the median household income? What about the relationship between Special Education and racial makeup? Does it appear that being non-white raises the chances a student is referred for Special Education services? Does there appear to be a correlation between the percentage of students in Special Education and the district's dropout rate?
* It is generally accepted that small classroom size leads to better academic results. Is the same true for districts? Do small districts outperform larger ones?
